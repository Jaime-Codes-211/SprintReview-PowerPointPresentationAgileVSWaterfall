# SprintReview-Retrospective

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

A successful software developer must be equipped with necessary documentation from the Product Owner that provides detailed information for projects, called user stories. Communication is important to decide what work will be excecuted for programs and updates, so that the team of developers and testers have correct instructions to build the software. User stories are information that allow developers to gather facts for the new software directly from stakeholders to be used as input for applications and development. They are crucial to creating products and are included from the start of projects to ensure the work being completed is exactly what is being requested and incrementally built.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Developing programs is done in phases. Planning, design, development, testing, and publication are steps to deliver proffessional programs with accurate results. Agile processes help to build communication and provide feedback throughout teams, meetings to track progress with a Scrum Master and Product Owner, and allow project releases to be completed in stages until the project is complete.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Communication, accuracy, transperancy, effort, and collaboration are effective ethics of being a good team member in software development. It is important to make sure that everyone provides updates with their work, timeliness, and informs the Product Owner and Scrum Master of any information that needs to be verified to ensure accurate product delivery.
